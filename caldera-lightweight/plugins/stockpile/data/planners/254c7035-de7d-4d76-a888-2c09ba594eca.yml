description: |
  The look ahead planner decides what abilities to use based on anticipated
  future rewards.  It takes as input a table of ability rewards, a depth
  parameter, and a discount factor.  The depth parameter effectively controls
  the "look-ahead" for the planner as it's scoring each action, and the
  discount factor controls how the planner weighs future rewards.
